/**
* Method returns the social leaderboard. A player's social leaderboard is
* comprised of players who are recognized as being your friend.
* For now, this applies solely to Facebook connected players who are
* friends with the logged in player (who also must be Facebook connected).
* In the future this will expand to other identification means (such as
* Game Centre, Google circles etc).
*
* Leaderboards entries contain the player's score and optionally, some user-defined
* data associated with the score. The currently logged in player will also
* be returned in the social leaderboard.
*
* Note: If no friends have played the game, the bestScore, createdAt, updatedAt
* will contain NULL.
*
* @param leaderboardId The id of the leaderboard to retrieve
* @param replaceName If true, the currently logged in player's name will be replaced
* by the string "You".
* @param completionBlock Block to call on return of successful server response
* @param errorCompletionBlock Block to call on return of unsuccessful server response
* @param cbObject User object sent to the completion blocks
*
* @returns JSON string representing the entries in the leaderboard.
* Note that the friend summary data is returned for each record
* in the leaderboard.
